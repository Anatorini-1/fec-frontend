# FEC-Frontend

This is a simple React-based application serving as a frontend to a project simulating a data transfer via a noisy channel, with the usage of foreward error correction codes. This app let you make a request to the api with the chosen encoding, channel parameters
and user-provided or random generated data (either text or bitmaps).
The api: https://github.com/Anatorini-1/foreward-error-correction
